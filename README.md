# Front-End Framework

Front-End Framework is a modular framework developed to be a boilerplate for your web projects. It uses Sass, Kit, and Grunt as task runner.


## Requirements

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)  
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)  
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)  
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)


## Usage

Assuming that all the requirements above are installed, download the [latest version](https://github.com/rafael-rpa/front-end-framework/archive/master.zip), uncompress and run ```npm install``` command under *_framework/grunt/* directory. Once installed run ```grunt``` in the same directory and the framework is ready to use.

P.S.: ```npm install``` command need to be entered only once, in the first time that you have created the project, on the contrary, ```grunt``` command has to be running everytime that you are developing using the framework.
